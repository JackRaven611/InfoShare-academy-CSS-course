            <h1>CSS For Beginners</h1>

            <p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. 
                Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After 
                the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don’t know exactly 
                when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide…
                and only five made it out.</p>
                
            <p>Now we took an oath, that I’m breaking now. We said we’d say it was the snow
                that killed the other two, but it wasn’t. Nature is lethal but it doesn’t
                hold a candle to man. Look, just because I don’t be givin’ no man a foot
                massage don’t make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwone into a
                glass motherfuckin’ house, fuckin’ up the way the nigger talks.
                Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, ’cause I’ll kill
                the motherfucker, know what I’m sayin’?</p>
                    
            <p>The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the 
                selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity
                and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness, for he is truly
                his brother’s keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon
                thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and
                destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is the Lord when I lay My vengeance
                upon thee.</p>
